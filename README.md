### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>My name is Cindy and I'm a current high school student attending a governor's school with a specialization in Science and Technology. I plan to major in Computer Science, and currently I have a focus in Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. In my free time, I enjoy coding discord bots/Minecraft plugins, playing bedwars, playing piano, and doing musical theater.</p><br>
